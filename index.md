## Aim of the Workshop

To reach top-tier performance, deep learning models usually require a large number of parameters and operations, and thus use considerable power and memory. Several works have proposed to tackle this problem using quantization of parameters, pruning, clustering of parameters, decompositions of convolutions or using distillation. However, most of these works aim at accelerating \textbf{only} the inference process and disregard the training phase. In practice, however, it is the learning phase that is by far the most complex. There has been recent efforts in introducing some compression on training process, however it remains challenging.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/HAET2021/HAET2022/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
